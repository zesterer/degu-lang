# Degu
------

An object-oriented compiled language designed for systems development.

## Why use Degu?

Degu is designed to fulfill several objectives.

* Low-level structure that maps well to assembly code
* Object-oriented model that allows some level of abstraction
* Context-aware syntax that respects the principle of encapsulation

* Provide a unified approach to data-driven and code-driven programming

As of the current time, Degu is still in heavy development.
