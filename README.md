# Degu
======

An object-oriented compiled language designed for systems development

## Why use Degu?

Degu is designed to fulfill several objectives.

* Low-level structure that maps well to assembly code
* Object-oriented model that allows some level of abstraction
* Context-aware syntax that respects the principle of encapsulation
* Logical syntax that makes clearly ambiguities that exist in other languages such as C
